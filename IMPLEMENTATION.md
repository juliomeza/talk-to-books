# BookTalk Implementation Progress

## Completed Features

1. **Book Text Extraction and Processing**
   - Implemented `BookParser` service to parse PDF, DOCX, and TXT files
   - Added text chunking for embedding generation
   - Created persistent FAISS vector store with disk storage

2. **Personality Extraction**
   - Added `PersonalityExtractor` service to analyze book personalities and characters
   - Integrated with Google's Gemini AI for personality analysis

3. **RAG Pipeline Implementation**
   - Enhanced RAG service with proper LLM integration (Google Gemini)
   - Added personality-aware generation for book and character voices
   - Improved vector search with book filtering

4. **Backend Infrastructure**
   - Added background task processing for book uploads
   - Enhanced Firebase service with book metadata update capability
   - Created proper environment configuration and data directory structure
   - Added API health check endpoint and request logging

5. **Mock Data Generation**
   - Created script to generate mock books for testing
   - Added mock book data to FAISS vector store
   - Implemented mock Firebase service for local development

6. **Frontend and Backend Services**
   - Successfully started and tested backend FastAPI server
   - Verified frontend Next.js server functionality
   - Set up core dependencies for both services

## Next Steps

1. **Integration Testing**
   - Test end-to-end flow from frontend to backend
   - Validate chat functionality with mock books
   - Test book upload and processing

2. **User Experience Improvements**
   - Add loading indicators for book uploads
   - Enhance ChatInterface to better display personality information
   - Improve source chunk display with highlighting
   - Implement character selection UI improvements

3. **Authentication Flow**
   - Implement proper Firebase authentication
   - Test login/logout functionality
   - Add protected routes for user-specific content

4. **Deployment Preparation**
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline
   - Create Docker containers for easy deployment
   - Configure production-ready settings

## Contribution Guidelines

When adding new features, please follow these guidelines:

1. Use consistent error handling and logging
2. Add proper documentation with docstrings
3. Include type hints for all functions
4. Create tests for new functionality
5. Update DEVELOPMENT.md with new implementation details

## Current Architecture

```
Frontend (Next.js + TypeScript)
  ↓
  ↓ HTTP/REST
  ↓
Backend (FastAPI + Python)
  ├── Book Parser: Extracts and chunks text from books
  ├── Embedding Service: Generates vector embeddings using Google API
  ├── FAISS Vector Store: Stores and searches book chunks
  ├── Personality Extractor: Analyzes book/character personalities
  ├── RAG Service: Implements the retrieval-augmentation-generation pipeline
  └── Firebase Service: Handles authentication, storage, and metadata
```
